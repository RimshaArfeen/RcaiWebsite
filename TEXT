          <p>Cotton is a natural crop, and it is one of the world’s expanding textile industries. This industry yearly
            gives at least $600 billion worldwide. 60% of Pakistan's overseas earnings occupy the production of cotton
            products. Many types of pests and viruses attack cotton crops. These viruses are present mainly in the
            weeds. These weeds are found along the roads, water channels, and field banks. Weed management is very much
            important to save our cotton crops as well as the quality of the cotton crops. The research team of Smart
            City lab NCAI developed autonomous weed detection with the help of automatic remote-controlled cars to
            manage weeds. This vehicle is equipped with vision sensors and can achieve efficient weed management. An
            intelligent decision support system based on potential algorithms of AI and ML serves the purpose.</p>

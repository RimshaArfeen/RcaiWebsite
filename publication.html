              <p>Using the processing power of multi-gigahertz 
                general purpose processors (GPP) to perform radio functions 
                can be a better and economical option to design a software 
                defined radio (SDR) system. An efficient SDR system with 
                multiple protocol support can be designed by identifying 
                different blocks in the channel processing stream of different 
                wireless protocols that can be mapped on GPP and field 
                programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) processing platforms 
                depending on throughput requirements of the corresponding 
                protocol. This paper presents the ongoing research work in 
                designing a novel architecture to prototype and develop 
                efficient SDR systems using GPP as main digital signal 
                processing (DSP) platform along with FPGAs to perform realtime signal processing tasks that can not be handled by GPPs. 
                In this research project, a software defined radio is designed 
                for the physical layer of WLAN standard IEEE 802.11a 
                receiver. Different sub-systems of the channel processing 
                stream of IEEE 802.11a OFDM receiver are mapped on GPP of 
                a PC and a PCI board containing fast ADCs to receive the 
                received analog signal from the RF front-end. The software 
                radio architecture discussed in this paper is a scaled down 
                version of the software radio that has to be developed as the 
                research project for M.Engg. by research at NED University by 
                the principal author.

                Visual Landmarks Recognition of Urban
                Structures using Convolutional Neural Network 
              </span>
            </header>
            <main class="modall__content">
              <p>The
                landmark Recognition of any urban structure is a
                frustrating task to accomplish. This paper presents a
                deep learning based approach for recognition of the
                urban structures. Urban structures are basically the
                usual offices, houses, apartments etc. A generalized word
                for all these buildings can be urban structures. This
                classification problem was identified by our team while
                making our way into the visual positioning system, we
                saw that the visual landmark recognition of urban
                structures was an unexplored domain by using deep
                learning approaches. We also Identified that unlike the
                landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Statue Of Liberty
                etc, urban structures were difficult to learn by a neural
                network, the data requirements were quite distinct
                compared to the ones mentioned for all these famous
                landmarks around the globe. Most of all the landmark
                database was created, augmented, labelled and preprocessed in lab. The transfer learning based
                approaches were not that useful since the overall size of
                the model would always be so enormous and integration
                of a transfer learning based model would be meaningless
                for any deployed web app or even for a local mobile
                based app. By collecting and engineering our own data
                using a data collection app, we have proposed a neural
                architecture which can be configured to learn multiple
                number of urban landmarks while retaining its overall
                size under 60MBs. This was achieved by a Convolutional
                Neural Network based binary classification model
                trained on landmarks existing in our university. Later
                this was deployed on a web based application and
                further on it is being made into an app. Keywords—Deep Learning, Landmarks Recognition,

              <p>In neuroscience, there is substantial evidence that suggests temporal filtering of
                stimulus by synaptic connections. In this paper, a novel frequency-dependent plasticity
                mechanism (FDSP) for neurocomputing applications is presented. It is proposed that synaptic
                junctions could be used to perform bandpass filtering on the input stimulus. The unique transfer
                function of a bandpass filter replaces the conventional weight value associated with synaptic
                connections. The proposed model has been simulated and rigorously tested with standard
                machine learning benchmarks such as XOR and multivariate IRIS dataset while utilising
                minimum resources. The proposed model offers a unique advantage and has the potential to
                overcome the burden of hidden layer neurons from the network. Exclusion of hidden layer from
                the network significantly reduces the size of the network and hence the computational effort
                required for classification tasks. The proposed FDSP mechanism allows for complete analogue
                system design with a frequency multiplexed communication scheme. The main goal of this study
                is to establish frequency-dependent plasticity as an alternative to existing time-domain-based
                techniques. The proposed method has a number of applications in neurocomputing, low power
                IoT devices and compute-efficient deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs).</p> <a target="_blank"  href="https://smartcitylab.neduet.edu.pk/r_papers/2.pdf">Read More</a>

              <p>In this research work, machine learning algorithms were applied to find the relationship between independent
                variables and dependent variables for soil data analysis. The independent variables include moisture,
                temperature, soil pH, Cation Exchange Capacity(CEC) whereas, the dependent variables include Nitrogen,
                Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK). This research concludes relationships between Phosphorus, Potassium, soil
                pH and CEC; Nitrogen and soil moisture and temperature using machine learning(ML) algorithms so as to
                deduce NPK content of soil. A comparative analysis with obtained results from each ML method is also
                presented. Machine learning algorithms are best performed on data with multiple independent variables. The
                values computed for nitrogen relationship were more accurate than PK relationship values. The accuracy of data
                set I was less than data set II. A large data set would produce more accurate results for both data sets.</p> <a target="_blank" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322530342.pdf">Read paper</a>

              <p>— The spatial and temporal distribution of active
                users across a given region greatly affects the activity of
                base stations (BSs) and the cumulative interference in a wireless network. In this letter, we propose a new approach for
                spatio-temporal analysis of wireless networks wherein stochastic
                geometry is used for the spatial domain and ON/OFF traffic
                models are used for the temporal domain. We illustrate the
                proposed approach through a mix of file transfer protocol (FTP)
                and video streaming (VS) traffic. With the aid of semi-Markov
                process, we derive the stationary probability for a given service
                request. Further, we develop a joint spatio-temporal model for
                the distribution of active users under a random BS.</p> <a target="_blank" href="papers/5.pdf">Read paper</a>

              <p>With changing climate, heatstroke has proved
                to be disastrous for few countries especially. The dwellers of

                whole city, while temperature varies at different altitudes and
                over short distances. The solution provided in the paper, is a
                smart weather station that not only monitor weather data but
                also predict it and generate instant alerts for dwellers of
                different areas, to help them be warned of the future hazard,
                using the combination of Internet of things and Machine
                Learning. It is deployed with different sensors that collect
                weather data from the environment, which are sent to cloud,

              <p>— Speech recognition in a signal with low SNR is a

            <main class="modall__content">
              <p>There has been a growing interest and motivation in analog electronic circuit modeling of bio-cellular networks, which forms the basis of cellular functions of all living organisms. The complexity and size of such networks has made this task arduous, while opening up new opportunities as well. A number of modeling techniques, from mathematical models to computer simulations, have been used in this domain to aid the interpretation of such complex and sophisticated networks. This research article focuses on modeling of bio-cellular structures and processes on silicon substrate using transistors in analog domain. MOS transistor analogies for some very commonly found bio-cellular reactions namely receptor–ligand kinetics and Michaelis Menten kinetics have been presented, which are based on previously established ordinary differential equation representation models of these bio-cellular processes. It has been shown mathematically and through simulations that a number of bio-chemical entities in the kinetic processes map naturally to some electronic entities, and exploiting these similarities can drastically reduce the size of the corresponding silicon mimetics. The suggested circuits use lesser number of transistors than the existing approaches in this domain, while producing the same behavior satisfactorily. This can to some extent ease the development of larger networks with more complex interactions, hence mitigating the intricacy involved in cellular processes when viewed as a complete system and can contribute positively to multiple disciplines like genetics, bio-informatics, medical sciences, and even computer science and engineering.</p> <a target="_blank" href="papers/10.pdf">Read paper</a>

              <p>Warehouse is one of the most dangerous places to work because of many
                potential dangers. The accidents caused by heavy vehicles result in serious
                injuries and even death. This paper proposes a solution to this problem.
                When a worker happens to be in any of such hazardous situations inside or
                outside workplace, he will press the emergency button (or pull a magnetic
                cord) placed in the smart safety belt which will not only stop the vehicles
                within 15 meters circle but also inform the workers within 250 meters circle
                through an indicator. In this technical paper, the outcome of first design
                phase has been reported. In the first design phase, we have successfully
                implemented a reliable and accurate ranging mechanism with ±0.3m
                maximum error. This ranging mechanism is based on wellknown RF Timeof-Flight (TOF) method. The maximum achievable transmit range of this

              <p>—Media Access Control (MAC) layer protocols
                have a critical role in making a typical Wireless Sensor
                Network (WSN) more reliable and efficient. Choice of
                MAC layer protocol and other factors including number
                of nodes, mobility, traffic rate and playground size
                dictates the performance of a particular WSN. In this
                paper, the performance of an experimental WSN is
                evaluated using different MAC layer protocols. In this
                experiment, a WSN is created using OMNeT++ MiXiM
                network simulator and its performance in terms of packet

              <p>This paper focuses on the design optimization of gm-boosted common gate (CG) CMOS low-noise
                amplifier (LNA) for ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology. In this regard, a detailed novel analysis of
                the UWB gm-boosted CG amplifier topology is presented, which includes the finite gds (¼1/reds) effects. For
                UWB systems, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be defined as the matched filter bound (MFB). Using this
                definition, the noise performance of the UWB CG LNA in the presence of the gm-boosting gain and the input
                noise-matching network are analyzed. It is found that the optimal noise factor of the UWB LNA collapses
                to the published narrowband gm-boosted CG LNA noise factor when an assumption of narrowband is
                applied. It is also proved that the noise performance of the gm-boosted UWB CG LNA is independent of the
                bandwidth of the input UWB signal. A new technique is presented for the design of optimal noisematching network using passive components at the input of the UWB CG LNA. In this regard, role of the
                gm-boosting stage and its effect on the SNR and the gain of the overall system are analyzed, and, in
                addition, its non-idealities are simulated in detail.</p> <a target="_blank" href="papers/16.pdf">Read paper</a>

Performance was optimized by employing the transconductance ‘g m ’ boosted CG LNA topology with series peaking along with an input noise matching network. A common source g m -boosting amplifier, in conjunction with an LC T-network, was used to share the bias current with the CG stage. The LNA was demonstrated using a 130 nm IBM CMOS process technology and it consumed 7 mW from a 1 V supply. It exhibited an input return loss (S11) and an output return loss (S22) of −10.5 and −14 dB respectively. In addition, it also achieved a forward power gain (S21) of 14.5 dB and a noise figure between 4.5 and 5.0 dB.</p> <a target="_blank" href="papers/18.pdf">Read paper</a>

                LNA topology addresses the issue of noise reduction keeping the power
                consumption to a minimum by employing the transconductance ‘‘gm’’
                boosted common gate (CG) LNA topology with series peaking, operating
                in the WiMedia spectrum. This CG LNA utilizes an active gm-boosting
                stage where the bias current is shared between the gm-boosting stage
                and the self-biased CG amplifying stage. In conjunction with an LC Tnetwork to further reduce the noise figure (NF) of the CG stage with
                finite output conductance (gds), inductive series peaking is used to widen
                the operating pass-band. The proposed LNA is designed using the 130
                nm IBM CMOS process and achieved an input return loss (S11) and an
                output return loss (S22) of 10 dB and 14 dB, respectively. The LNA
                exhibits forward power gain (S21) of around 14 dB with a NF ranging
                between 3.5 and 4.1 dB. The complete chip dissipates 5 mW from a 1.0
                V supply with an input referred third order intercept point (IIP3) and an
                input referred 1-dB compression point (ICP1dB) of 4.8 dBm and 12.1
                dBm, respectively. VC 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt

              <p>Propels in innovation have conveyed to us another
                type of advanced radio administration called 'Spread Spectrum'.
                Initially created by the military as an impediment to sticking and
                listening stealthily (undercover work), the spread-range system
                handles radio flag uniquely in contrast to different types of
                advanced radio. It utilizes 2.4 Gigahertz ISM-band of recurrence.
                DSS Spectrum is essentially a spreading development strategy
                which is broadly utilized as a part of various WLAN
                correspondence plans; for example, cellular WiFi frameworks
                (IEEE 80211b standard), Videoconferencing, Military
                applications, Utilities like power, oil, gas and water, Global
                Positioning System (GPS) and LAN/WAN/Internet associations.
                DSSS deliver a spreading gain in contrast to narrow-band
                meddling signals and it extents the broadcasted signal across an
                extensive range so the transmission bear a resemblance to noise
                to a narrow-band receiver. This DSSS based Transmitter reaches
                up to 38 meter indoor and 140 meter outside. The philosophy for
                this examination task in light of computerized sign preparing

              Plastic Waste Management through the Development of a Low
Cost and Light Weight Deep Learning Based Reverse
Vending Machine
             </span>
            </header>
            <main class="modall__content">
              <p>: The management of the abundant amount of used plastic bottle waste is a major concern
                nowadays, because it is a major contributor to landfills and overburdens waste processing facilities.
                Once disposed of, plastic can take centuries to break down, hence, recycling not only manages
                the waste efficiently, but it reduces the environmental impact and creates economic opportunities,
                as well. An incentive-based Reverse Vending machine (RVM) is an effective way to involve the
                general public in the management of plastic waste. The existing solutions are either very expensive,
                from a computation and cost perspective, or they lack the robustness and durability necessary for
                deployment. In this research, we have developed an incentive-based low-cost RVM for the collection,
                identification, classification, and sorting of used plastic bottles with the addition of a reward-based
                user application. The developed RVM includes a low-cost computing device running a lightweight
                image processing algorithm, sensors, camera, and a self-designed mechanical arm. To support
                the low computing device in the RVM, a lightweight MobileNet model has been trained using
                transfer learning. A dataset of 10,983 pet bottle images was collected using a camera installed inside
                the machine for the classification model. The results of the study show that MobileNet achieved
                99.2% testing accuracy, which is better than the existing bottle-classification approaches. Moreover,
                the weight of the developed model was only 12 Mb, which is fourteen and six times less than
                inceptionV3 and Res-Net (Residual Neural Networks), respectively. Furthermore, the developed
                RVM costs a fraction of the price, compared to the existing solutions. Two versions of the machine
                have been deployed at a University for more than 6 months, collecting over 650 kg of plastic waste.

                Rapid Testing System for Rice Quality Control through
Comprehensive Feature and Kernel-Type Detection

            </header>

              <p>The assessment of food quality is of significant importance as it allows control over
                important features, such as ensuring adherence to food standards, longer shelf life, and consistency
                and quality of taste. Rice is the predominant dietary source of half the world’s population, and
                Pakistan contributes around 80% of the rice trade worldwide and is among the top three of the largest
                exporters. Hitherto, the rice industry has depended on antiquated methods of rice quality assessment
                through manual inspection, which is time consuming and prone to errors. In this study, an efficient
                desktop-application-based rice quality evaluation system, ‘National Grain Tech’, based on computer
                vision and machine learning, is presented. The analysis is based on seven main features, including
                grain length, width, weight, yellowness, broken, chalky, and/or damaged kernels for six different
                types of rice: IRRI-6, PK386, 1121 white and Selah, Super kernel basmati brown, and white rice. The
                system was tested in rice factories for 3 months and demonstrated 99% accuracy in determining
                the size, weight, color, and chalkiness of rice kernels. An accuracy of 98.8% was achieved for the
                classification of damaged and undamaged kernels, 98% for determining broken kernels, and 100%
                for paddy kernels. The results are significant because the developed system improves the local rice
                quality testing capacity through a faster, more accurate, and less expensive mechanism in comparison
                to previous research studies, which only evaluated four features of the singular rice type, rather than
                the seven features achieved in this study for six rice types

            <main class="modall__content">
              <p>End-to-end learning for autonomous driving uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the steering angle from a raw image input. Most of the solutions available for end-to-end autonomous driving are computationally too expensive, which increases the inference of autonomous driving in real time. Therefore, in this paper, CNN architecture has been trained which is lightweight and achieves comparable results to Nvidia’s PilotNet. The data used to train and evaluate the network is collected from the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator. To evaluate the proposed architecture, the MSE (mean squared error) is used as the performance metric. Results of the experiment shows that the proposed model is 4x lighter than Nvidia’s PilotNet in term of parameters but still attains comparable results to PilotNet. The proposed model has achieved  MSE on testing data while PilotNet MSE was 4.7x10 ^(-4) .

                Impacts of Urbanization on Green Spaces of the Densely Populated City of

              <p>Growing population, uncontrolled migration, and unplanned urbanization are prevalent worldwide and Pakistan is no exception with Karachi ranking as Asia's
                fifth and the world's eleventh most populous metropolis. Urbanization is occurring at the expense of environmental degradation and a decline in the amount of
                Urban Green Spaces (UGS). The WHO recommends at least 9 square meters (m2) of green space per person, with a UGS value of 50 m2 per capital as the
                optimum green space for environmental sustainability. The study region consisted of six districts in Karachi, and their percentage of green space was
                calculated. Satellite images from the Landsat-8 Surface reflectance Tier-1 satellite program were used in this study. To perform calculations and detect land
                cover changes, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a widely used index to calculate the density of green area for a specific part of the land, is
                used. The results concluded that Karachi's green land cover has changed from 6.30% in January 2014 to 11.28% in January 2021, at NDVI > 0.3. These
                statistics of NDVI greater than 0.3 indicate sparse or moderate vegetation hence the possibility of including wild grass and bushes in the analysis is
                eliminated. Only a five percent (5%) rise over an eight-year period suggests the necessity for drastic action to improve the quantity and condition of UGS in
                Karachi. This study shows how Karachi's green spaces have been steadily being destroyed by uncontrolled urbanization and the yearly changes in vegetation.
                This research will help urban planners and policymakers to make wise choices for environmental sustainability in urban areas

                its potential for controlling thousands of accidents that happen yearly due to human error.
                However, AV bring with it very complex and sophisticated requirements and challenges
                related to extensive testing of the algorithms and hardware in the physical world. The evolution
                of automotive simulation tools provides an opportunity to fully test and validate AV
                architectures without the risk of creating hazardous situations in real world. This research
                demonstrates the application of HD (High Definition) maps in autonomous vehicle navigation
                using ROS interface integrated with the CARLA (CAR Learning to Act) simulator. The sensor
                data includes Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), RGB-Depth (RGB-D), and vehicle
                odometry. HD maps play an important role in robustness of the autonomous systems where due
                to sensor obstruction or weather conditions the vehicle is unable to perceive the information
                ahead. It also aids the vehicle to sense its environment even outside from the sensor’s field of
                view. The research is divided into the three fundamental concepts of Simultaneous
                Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approach that is, (i) mapping, (ii) localization, and (iii)
                navigation. Two ROS tools are used for mapping, (a) OctoMap mapping, and (ii) Real-Time
                Appearance-Based Mapping (RTAB-Map). We demonstrate the effectiveness of localization
                using RTAB-Map and compare actual path, position and orientation to their estimated
                equivalents. Our results show acceptable error in XY axes and exemplifies the error
                accumulated in Z axis.

                Integrating Stochastic Geometry and ON/OFF Traffic
Models: Toward Spatio-Temporal Analysis of
Wireless Networks With Heterogeneous Services

              <p>Wireless networks (4G, 5G, etc.) of today are
                witnessing a continuously increasing level of heterogeneity in
                terms of supported services and applications. Spatio-temporal
                modeling of wireless networks plays a crucial role, not only in
                design and analysis but also for critical performance metrics.
                Therefore, in this work, we develop a joint model for the analysis
                of wireless networks wherein users can request for different
                services and can generate multiple flows. By assuming single flow
                per user for a given service request, we derive the packet arrival
                probability of the user by using ON/OFF traffic model.
                Moreover, we derive the probability mass function (pmf) for the
                number of active users under a base station (BS). By assuming a
                heterogeneous traffic scenario wherein a user can generate
                multiple flows for different services, we derive the pmf for the
                number of active users under a BS. To analyze the performance
                of wireless network, we derive critical performance metrics
                which include success probability, mean delay and stable region
                probability. For computationally efficient implementation of the
                derived expressions, we also develop a algorithm which takes
                significantly less time. We benchmark the derived expressions
                against state-of-the-art literature.

              A Deep Learning-Based Sensor Modeling for Smart
Irrigation System

              <p>The use of Internet of things (IoT)-based physical sensors to perceive the environment is a
                prevalent and global approach. However, one major problem is the reliability of physical sensors’
                nodes, which creates difficulty in a real-time system to identify whether the physical sensor is
                transmitting correct values or malfunctioning due to external disturbances affecting the system,
                such as noise. In this paper, the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based neural networks is
                proposed as an alternate approach to address this problem. The proposed solution is tested for a
                smart irrigation system, where a physical sensor is replaced by a neural sensor. The Smart Irrigation
                System (SIS) contains several physical sensors, which transmit temperature, humidity, and soil
                moisture data to calculate the transpiration in a particular field. The real-world values are taken from
                an agriculture field, located in a field of lemons near the Ghadap Sindh province of Pakistan. The
                LM35 sensor is used for temperature, DHT-22 for humidity, and we designed a customized sensor in
                our lab for the acquisition of moisture values. The results of the experiment show that the proposed
                deep learning-based neural sensor predicts the real-time values with high accuracy, especially the
                temperature values. The humidity and moisture values are also in an acceptable range. Our results
                highlight the possibility of using a neural network, referred to as a neural sensor here, to complement
                the functioning of a physical sensor deployed in an agriculture field in order to make smart irrigation
                systems more reliable

              <p> Locating a dynamic object in an industrial environment in real time has been a significant
                scientific problem. The precise localization and positioning of an object are achieved by Satellite
                communication, Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), Bluetooth technologies, etc. The use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been a success for locating an object in an outdoor environment, but indoor
                positioning has been impractical when using this technology. A good option is to utilize short-range
                Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology with Time of Flight, Time Difference of Arrival, and Phase
                difference of Arrival methods for precise ranging applications. In this research paper, we presented
                an accurate indoor positioning system using a UWB radio-based embedded system. The system
                deployed multiple fixed positioning stations called anchors, programmed to detect the position of
                the dynamic object. The presented system in this paper calculates the object position by using the
                Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) method and the triangulation method. The Indoor Positioning
                System (IPS) is found to effectively locate the dynamic object in three-dimensional space within an
                error rate of +/−0.07 m.

              <p>Cerebral tuberculosis (TB) is one of the
                neurological manifestations of tuberculosis infections
                responsible for devastating sequelae and mortality. It is a 
                challenge to diagnose as it mimics other infectious and 
                neoplastic pathologies of the brain. There is a need for a rapid 
                and accurate diagnostic approaches, in order to prevent the
                dismal outcomes arising as a result of delayed or incorrect 
                diagnosis. This paper aims to develop a classifier to diagnose
                cerebral TB using various radiological features present on 
                Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain with the help 
                of Machine Learning (ML). Cases of TB and non-TB conditions 
                (including meningiomas, gliomas, fungal and bacterial brain 
                infection) presenting to Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, 
                Pakistan, were included and divided into training and test
                datasets. Features were selected using correlation, and besides 
                age and gender, included multiple radiological features
                recorded from MRI of the brain. After the application of 
                Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), 
                SMOTE-Tomek Links, Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) 
                SMOTE-ENN, and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) techniques
                for balancing the datasets, classifier accuracy was tested using 
                two models: logistic regression and random forest. Highest
                accuracy (90.9%) was achieved using logistic regression along 
                with SMOTE+TOMEK with 95.4% Area under the Curve
                while obtaining a F1 score of 92.8%.

              <p> Over recent years, the demand for supplies of freshwater is escalating with the increasing
                food demand of a fast-growing population. The agriculture sector of Pakistan contributes to 26% of
                its GDP and employs 43% of the entire labor force. However, the currently used traditional farming
                methods such as flood irrigation and rotating water allocation system (Warabandi) results in excess
                and untimely water usage, as well as low crop yield. Internet of things (IoT) solutions based on
                real-time farm sensor data and intelligent decision support systems have led to many smart farming
                solutions, thus improving water utilization. The objective of this study was to compare and optimize
                water usage in a 2-acre lemon farm test site in Gadap, Karachi, for a 9-month duration, by deploying
                an indigenously developed IoT device and an agriculture-based decision support system (DSS). The
                sensor data are wirelessly collected over the cloud and a mobile application, as well as a web-based
                information visualization, and a DSS system makes irrigation recommendations. The DSS system
                is based on weather data (temperature and humidity), real time in situ sensor data from the IoT
                device deployed in the farm, and crop data (Kc and crop type). These data are supplied to the
                Penman–Monteith and crop coefficient model to make recommendations for irrigation schedules
                in the test site. The results show impressive water savings (~50%) combined with increased yield
                (35%) when compared with water usage and crop yields in a neighboring 2-acre lemon farm where
                traditional irrigation scheduling was employed and where harsh conditions sometimes resulted in
                temperatures in excess of 50 ◦C.

              <p>Social media can complement organizational communication strategy which is integral to employee engagement. However, successful case studies which can allow replication are limited. The objective of the study is to describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a social media-based communication strategy in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. The leadership of the pediatric service line developed an intervention plan to engage the employees with the newly reframed vision to improve patient and family experience. An online communication platform—Facebook page—was created for all employees of the pediatric service line. The strategy to influence employees was based on Cialdini's six principles of persuasion. Implementation of the strategy between October 2017 and December 2019 was evaluated for reach, discussion themes, and outcomes using the framework by Murdough (2009). Quantitative indicators included total posts, mean comments, and reactions per post. Posts were qualitatively analyzed with an emergent approach for insights into the discussion. The analysis revealed a total of 9,085 posts, with mean reactions per post of 8.4, mean comments of 7.2, and active viewership by 90% members on average. In terms of post types, photos were the highest (4,779), while videos were the lowest (1,163). Qualitative analysis indicated 54% of the posts were of the theme “inspirational and thought provoking,” while the greatest engagement was generated on the theme “challenges and solution.” The authors conclude that the strategy was successfully implemented to maintain active membership, engage employees in meaningful conversations, and have them express intent to execute quality improvement projects.

              <p>Modulation recognition plays a crucial role in noncooperative communication in which receivers have no prior information regarding transmitter modulation scheme. This paper
                presents a novel convolutional neural network with single Stem
                and Inception module for autonomous modulation classification
                from raw I/Q received channels. This addresses the computationally intensive problem of conversion of I/Q channels to
                constellation image processing. The proposed system is capable
                of classifying 11 standard modulation schemes with both 2D and
                3D input array configurations for varying SNR conditions. The
                performance of proposed system has been evaluated for a realtime communication system simulated with Rician fading channel
                and AWGN noise model, providing realistic distortion effects. The
                proposed CNN design achieves an average accuracy of 90% at 10
                dB and 99% at 20 dB SNR with reduced network learnables and
                lower training and testing time, which makes it computationally
                efficient. These attributes make Inception module based CNN a
                viable solution for modulation classification in practical low cost
                and portable yet reliable communication systems.

                Analog Electronic Circuits to Model Cooperativity in Hill
Process

              <p>In the field of computational biology, electronic modeling of bio-cellular processes is in vogue for about a couple 
                of decades. Fast, efficient and scalable electronic mimetics of recurrently found bio-chemical reactions are 
                expected to provide better electronic circuit simulators that can also be used as bio-sensors or implantable biodevices at cellular levels. This paper presents some possible electronic circuit equivalents to model dynamics of 
                one such bio-chemical reaction commonly involved in many bio-cellular processes, specifically pathways in 
                living cells, known as the Hill process. The distinguishing feature of this process is cooperativity which has been 
                modeled in silicon substrate using a pair of transistors, one transistor driving current in the other the same way 
                ligand binding to one receptor site controls the binding affinity of the other receptor sites. Two possible circuits 
                have been proposed and compared to electronically model cooperativity of a Hill reaction. The main idea is to 
                exploit the natural analogies found between structures and processes of a bio-cell and electronic transistor 
                mechanics, to efficiently model fundamental bio-chemical reactions found recurring in bio-processes. These 
                circuits can then be combined and rearranged quickly to form larger, more complex bio-networks, thus 
                mitigating the intricacies involved in modeling of such systems.

              <p>Offloading among multiple radio access technologies
                (RATs) is an effective solution to tackle some of the key challenges
                faced by 5G wireless networks. While making an offloading decision, in user-centric offloading schemes, the network context is
                not taken into account, which limits the full utilization of the
                potential offered by these techniques. Therefore, in this work,
                we develop a data offloading framework wherein a user defines
                a tuple, which includes a request for data service and the associated delay limit, and the user equipment (UE) translates this
                tuple into an optimal offloading policy by taking into account the
                network context. The data offloading problem is formulated by
                assuming a finite horizon Markov decision process (MDP), and
                an analytical data offloading model is derived by using stochastic geometry for modeling the spatial domain of a multi-RAT
                wireless network, and by employing Markov process for capturing mobility of users. In order to validate the performance of
                derived model, we also solve the offloading problem by using policy iteration (PI) algorithm. The results show that the analytical
                algorithm outperforms the iterative algorithm. We also benchmark the proposed framework against standard data offloading
                methods.

              <p>The lysis-lysogeny switch in E. coli due to
                infection from lambda phage has been extensively studied and explained by scientists of molecular biology. The
                bacterium either survives with the viral strand of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or dies producing hundreds of viruses
                for propagation of infection. Many proteins transcribed after
                infection by λ phage take part in determining the fate of the
                bacterium, but two proteins that play a key role in this regard
                are the cI and cro dimers, which are transcribed off the viral
                DNA. This paper presents a novel modeling mechanism for
                the lysis-lysogenyswitch, by transferring the interactions of
                the main proteins, the lambda right operator and promoter
                regions and the ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, to a
                finite state machine (FSM), to determine cell fate. The FSM,
                and thus derived is implemented in field-programmable gate
                array (FPGA), and simulations have been run in random
                conditions. A Markov model has been created for the same
                mechanism. Steady state analysis has been conducted for
                the transition matrix of the Markov model, and the results
                have been generated to show the steady state probability
                of lysis with various model values. In this paper, it is hoped
                to lay down guidelines to convert biological processes into
                computing machines.

              <p>Te increased penetration of diferent radio access technologies (RATs) and the growing trend towards their convergence
                necessitates the investigation of wireless heterogeneous networks (HetNets) from coverage and capacity perspective. Tis paper
                develops a unifed framework for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and rate coverage analysis of multi-RAT HetNets, with each
                RAT employing either a contention-free or a contention-based channel access strategy.Te proposed framework adopts tools from
                stochastic geometry, with the location of APs and mobile users modeled through independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). We
                specifcally focus on a two-RAT scenario (i.e., cellular and Wi-Fi), where for multi-tier Wi-Fi RAT, with contention-based channel
                access like CSMA/CA, the location dependent distribution of interfering APs has been approximated through a homogeneous PPP.
                Moreover, by using some simple yet realistic set of assumptions, the distance to nearest active AP has been defned which results in
                simplifed expressions. Te medium access probability for a random and a tagged AP under a multi-tier Wi-Fi RAT has also been
                derived and discussed. By keeping in view the tremendous efect of temporal domain on overall network performance, the stable
                queue probability has been derived by assuming a non-saturated trafc model. Te results have been validated through extensive
                simulations and compared with existing approaches. Some useful insights have also been presented that shed light on design and
                analysis of multi-RAT HetNets and provide motivation for further research in this direction.

              Robotics Education Methodology for K-12 Students for Enhancing Skill

              <p> Due to a visible gap in K-12 education that
                doesn’t address the importance of imparting technology literacy, project-based learning and transdisciplinary educational
                activities, there is a deficiency of skill sets harnessed by
                university students. This study is being initiated as part of
                an ongoing research to find out the potent educational reforms
                needed in K-12 years for enhancing skill sets needed by the
                21st century students prior to their enrollment in universities.
                Through this study, an open source educational robot - ProBot -
                and a software - EDVON - have been developed, and a proposed
                robotics education methodology was implemented in 17 schools,
                that has shown positive results in K-12 students’ learning and
                performance. The students were ultimately able to build their
                own robotics projects from scratch - those that are usually

              <p>  Lack of haptic feedback in prostheses is proving
                to be the bottleneck in the field. Closed loop prostheses
                should fill the gap for amputees to experience exteroceptive
                (environmental pressure) or proprioceptive (proper state or
                joint angles) by means of different sensory feedback. Detailed
                work is being done on the development of electrotactile and vibrotactile stimulation system. The objective of this research is to
                generate vibrotactile feedback on a residual arm of an amputee.
                With this research, it is an endeavor for amputees to possess
                cognitive response while holding something amid environmental
                interactions with the help of convenient methodology and with
                suitable components in hand. To make this design pertinent to
                the objective, we have used coin shaped vibration motors, 0.5-
                inch diameter circular FSR provide haptic feedback from the
                tip of the finger. 3D printed prosthetic hand proved to be the
                best remedy for lowering the cost. The research was conducted
                on 6 healthy subjects and one amputee. Experimental results
                showed the effectiveness of proposed approach.

              <p>  A platinum-free counter electrode composed of surface modified aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes
                (MWCNTs) fibers was fabricated for efficient flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Surface modification of MWCNTs
                fibers with simple one step hydrothermal deposition of cobalt selenide nanoparticles, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy
                and X-ray diffraction, provided a significant improvement (∼2-times) in their electrocatalytic activity. Cyclic voltammetry and
                electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggest a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 6.42% for our modified fibers, higher
                than 3.4% and 5.6% efficeincy of pristine MWCNTs fiber and commonly used Pt wire, respectively. Good mechanical and
                performance stability after repeated bending and high output voltage for in-series connection suggest that our surface modified
                MWCNTs fiber based DSSCs may find applications as flexible power source in next-generation flexible/wearable electronics.

              <p> A large body of researchers across the globe has been 
                moving genetically coded information and cellular processing 
                techniques to the mathematical domain in terms of analogous 
                variables and their equations. A recent trend has expanded this 
                movement further into the realms of electronics. Many different 
                attempts have been made to create electronic circuits and Boolean 
                machines that model the internal wirings of genetic circuits. This 
                paper presents a very well-known yet simple genetic circuit 
                created to demonstrate bistability in the cellular system. It looks 
                into the working of the Collins toggle switch (CTS), a synthetically 
                created system of two repressors and their respective inducers and 
                a reporter protein. The authors have created a finite state machine 
                that is defined with variables analogous to the proteins in the CTS 
                and responds to these variables in exactly the same way as the 
                plasmids of CTS respond to the original proteins. The finite state 
                machine analogue helps analyse the genetic circuit with greater 
                depth and elaboration.

              <p>Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast growing field and
                its purpose is to connect, objects with other objects or humans
                through internet and provide some useful data. Exploitation
                of data, gathered from objects of certain type, can help in
                making human life easier by making better decisions in business,
                weather, or any other field of study. Since weather is a very
                critical and important field of study and its real time analysis
                is really important for prediction of future trends. Therefore,
                in this research an IoT enabled ultrasonic anemometer has
                been designed which calculates wind speed & direction and
                uploads collected data to cloud. In depth analysis of equations for
                obtaining average wind speed and direction has been presented
                in this paper. The proposed design is very simple and cost
                effective because of chosen components i.e., ultrasonic sensors,
                ESP module, which are extremely cheap. The testbed of proposed
                solution was deployed at roof of Computer & Information
                Systems Engineering (CIS) department, NED UET over week
                duration. The results have been compared with Mechanical wind
                speed sensor deployed at top of Industrial & Manufacturing (IM)
                department of NED UET. Calibration of ultrasonic anemometer
                has also been carried out by exploiting simple machine learning
                techniques. Although the response time of two sensors are quite
                different however just for illustration and a better insight results
                obtained from two sensors has been compared, after applying
                ML on designed ultrasonic anemometer. The results obtained
                are satisfactory since the slope produced by two sensors is almost
                following the same path with certain bias.

            <main class="modall__content">
              <p>Wideband noise cancelling LNAs reported in recent literature consume very large power because of the additional stages required for noise cancelling. This makes them inappropriate for portable applications. Based on this fact, the design of a low power, noise cancelling, wideband LNA is presented in this paper. To demonstrate the proposed circuit, novel use of popular current reuse LNA architecture in combination with the noise cancellation technique is presented. The current reuse architecture aids in obtaining necessary phase difference between signal and noise while providing power optimization. This paper presents detailed mathematical analysis of the modified input impedance, gain and noise figure. The proposed LNA is designed for UWB applications using 130 nm IBM CMOS process. The simulation results demonstrated 3 dB bandwidth of 2.35–9.37 GHz with maximum forward gain (S21) of 10.3 dB and achieved minimum noise figure (NFmin) of 3.68 dB. The simulated input referred third order intercept point (IIP3) and 1 dB compression point (P1dB) are found to be −4 dBm and −12.55 dBm respectively. With a power supply of 1.3 V, the proposed circuit consumes 9.97 mW only.

              VLSI Design, Fabrication and Testing of an Ultra-Wideband

              <p>The wide operating bandwidth of the ultra-wideband (UWB) signal leads to new circuit 
                design challenges and methodologies. Similar to any other RF system, the most critical 
                component of the UWB receiver is the low noise amplifier (LNA). Contrary to the narrowband LNAs, the single-tone assumption is not valid for defining the SNR of an UWB LNA 
                where the input signal encompasses several GHz. Defining the UWB LNA system’s SNR 
                as the matched filter bound (MFB) is an appropriate approach to deduce its noise figure 
                (NF). Using this approach, a mathematical model is proposed to achieve optimal NF, 
                employing the gm-boosted common gate (CG) LNA topology along with a passive noise 
                matching input network. Besides the low noise performance, the other challenges in the 
                design of the UWB LNA include adequate input match and forward power gain with low 
                power dissipation. Considering the superior performance of the gm-boosted CG amplifier 
                topology for UWB, a new single-ended (SE) gm-boosted CG UWB LNA architecture is 
                proposed in this research. In the SE LNA architecture, the power dissipation is further 
                minimized by sharing the bias current between the gm-boosted CG and the active gmboosting amplifier stages in a current-reuse fashion (“piggyback” gm-boosting). The 
                proposed piggyback gm-boosted CG LNA, operating in 3-5 GHz range, is fabricated using 
                130nm RFCMOS process with adequate results. The noise optimization mathematical 
                model proposed in this thesis is applied to the new piggyback gm-boosted CG LNA 
                architecture by including an intervening noise matching passive network at the input of the 
                LNA. The bandwidth of the noise matched piggyback gm-boosted CG LNA is extended 
                using series peaking technique to the complete UWB band from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz. The 
                proposed full-band noise matched UWB LNA is fabricated in a differential manner using 
                130nm RFCMOS process and exhibited excellent performance improvements with figure 
                of merit (FOM) of 2.86.

              A 4 mW 3–5 GHz current reuse gm-boosted short channel
common-gate CMOS UWB LNA

              <p>A novel architecture is presented to optimize
                the noise performance and the power consumption of the
                transconductance ‘gm’ boosted common-gate (CG) ultrawideband (UWB) low-noise amplifier (LNA), operating in
                the 3–5 GHz range, by employing current reuse technique.
                This proposed CG LNA utilizes a common source (CS)
                amplifier as the gm-boosting stage and the bias current is
                shared between the gm-boosting stage and the CG amplifying stage. The LNA circuit also utilizes the short channel
                conductance gds in conjunction with an LC T-network to
                further reduce the noise figure (NF). The proposed LNA
                architecture has been fabricated using the 130 nm IBM
                CMOS process. The LNA achieved input return loss (S11)
                of -8 to -10 dB, and, output return loss (S22) of -12 to
                -14 dB, respectively. The LNA exhibits almost flat forward voltage gain (S21) of 13 dB, and reverse isolation (S12)
                of -62 to -49 dB, with a NF ranging between 3.8 and
                4.6 dB. The measurements indicate an input-referred third
                order intercept point (IIP3) of -6.1 dBm and an inputreferred 1-dB compression point (ICP1dB) of -15.4 dBm.
                The complete chip draws 4 mW of DC power from a 1.2 V
                supply.

              A lightweight Convolutional Neural network for End to

              <p>End-to-end learning for autonomous driving uses a convolutional Neural network(CNN) to predict steering angle from a raw image input. Most of the
                solutions available for end-to-end autonomous driving are computationally too
                expensive, which increases the inference of autonomous driving in real time.
                Therefore, in this paper CNN architecture has been trained which is lightweight
                and achieves comparable results to Nvidia’s PilotNet. The data used to train
                and evaluate the Network is collected from the Car Learning to Act (CARLA)
                simulator. To evaluate the proposed architecture the MSE(mean squared error)
                is used as the performance metric. Results of the experiment shows that the proposed model is 40x lighter than NVIDIA’s pilot net but still attains comparable
                results to Pilotnet. The proposed model has achieved 5.1 × 10−4 mean-squared
                error on testing data while Pilotnet MSE was 4.7 × 10−4
                .

              A Smart Safety Gadget Design to Avoid Accidents in Warehouse Environment
             </span>
            </header>
            <main class="modall__content">
              <p>  Warehouses are one of the most dangerous places to work because of sudden accidents caused by 
                automated machinery and vehicles. Such accidents can be prevented by stopping the machinery or alerting the operator 
                immediately when it is in close proximity of a worker. In this paper we present our design of a smart safety gadget that 
                can avoid this problem to a greater extent. The device is triggered by an easily accessible emergency rope or switch. 
                The gadget hosts an ultra-wide band (UWB) radio module for measuring distance between worker and machinery and 
                generates an alert signal to stop the vehicle if calculated distance is less than a defined programmable value (e.g. 10m). 
                Gadget also sends a distress signal to other workers within a 150m radius over range radio so that they can come to 
                assistance of worker. This ranging and alert mechanism has been successfully implemented on the demonstrated 
                prototype with ±0.3m maximum error.

                Over-the-air Programming for Low Cost, Small Scale WSNs 
based on ZigBee Protocol

              <p> The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the development of many complex networks built from 
                simple devices. Due to their many possible applications, each of these devices are required to be easily maintainable 
                and upgradable. Over-the-air programming (OTAP) is one of the methods to accomplish this. This paper introduces 
                an implementation of OTAP for the popular Arduino UNO using ZigBee protocol. Programs written in Arduino IDE 
                can be uploaded to the microcontroller over-the-air and executed without the need of any wired connections. 
                Evaluation of the implemented protocol showed a linear relationship between the programming latency and file size 
                whereas a negligible relationship between latency and the distance among the nodes.

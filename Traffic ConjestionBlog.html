    <div class="container blog-page  ">
        <div class="left pr-5">
            <p>
                Traffic congestion not only causes environmental degradation but also affects the overall health of citizens. Because of traffic congestion, it becomes difficult to carry out routine activities. It also has adverse effects on the economy; officers, workers, and businessmen stay stuck in the traffic for hours, negatively impacting their ability to perform.
                
            </p>
            <p>The Smart City Team is working on a traffic management system using artificial intelligence and IoT. The team conducted a detailed research on how traffic congestion financially affects an economy.They installed cameras on one of the busiest roads in Karachi – University Road – and visually observed the vicinity. The purpose was to calculate the difference between how much fuel vehicles consume during high traffic hours and how much do they consume during low traffic hours. It was found that vehicles consume twice as much fuel during high traffic hours, than what they do in low traffic hours.
            </p>
            <p>The team also calculated the cost spent on reducing the emissions and other environment protection schemes. To calculate the cost spent, the team targeted the same road, and studied how much cost is spent to make the environment better of that particular vicinity.
            </p>
           <p>The purpose of the research was to highlight the fall outs of traffic congestion, especially those related to health and economy. The findings were that the estimated cost of fuel consumed due to 10 minutes delay can be around 22.90 Million PKR/Year. The cost to overcome Carbon dioxide emissions by planting pine trees, could be around 37.73 Million PKR/ Year.
        </p>
        <p>Considering the research targeting the University Road, the team has made an estimate loss that could be cost because of traffic congestion in the city. They have found that the total loss cost due to congestion is 95.62 Billion PKR/Year for 15 minutes delay in Karachi. The estimation is based on also the report studied by the World Bank. According to the report, the health cost of ambient air pollution alone is 65 billion PKR/ Year.</p>
        <p>Some of the factors that can be considered to avoid the delay could be the repair and rehabilitation of roads causing congestion, reduction in diesel using vehicles, strict traffic rules implementation. Other ways can be by introducing the Hybrid vehicles, avoiding land degradation, installing smart cameras and using Artificial Intelligence. Plantation and real time traffic feedback can also be the part of long-term plan.</p>
